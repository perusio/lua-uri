This library allows you to normalize and validate URIs, and provides methods
for manipulating them in various ways.

The Lua-URI library is written in pure Lua.  No C compilation is required
to install it.

When you unpack the source code everything should already be ready for
installation.  Doing "make install" as root will install the Lua source
files and the man pages containing the documentation.

See lua-uri(3) for information about how to use the library.  The same
documentation is available on the website, where you can also get the
latest packages:
